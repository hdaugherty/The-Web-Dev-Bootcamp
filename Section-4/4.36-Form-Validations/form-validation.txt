Simple Validations
- The 'required' attribute validates that an input is not empty
- There are also type Validations. Try changing "type" from "text" to "email"

Ex.
<form action="/sign-in-url" method="post">
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input id="email" type="email" required>
  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input id="password" type="password" required>
  <button>Login</button>
</form>

- The required attribute means that the user cannot leave the field blank
